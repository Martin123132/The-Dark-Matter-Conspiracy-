The Dark Matter Conspiracy


Welcome to the repository that asks: What if everything you know about dark matter is wrong?


What Is This?


This repo is an open-access collection of analyses, code, simulations, and replication kits exposing the cracks in the standard dark matter paradigm.

You’ll find:

Reproducible simulations showing why “missing mass” can be explained by new physics (MBT and others).
Direct challenges to the “bulletproof” cases for dark matter, including the Bullet Cluster, galaxy rotation curves, and gravitational lensing.
Source code, real observational data, and clear instructions for anyone to check or challenge the results.
Bonus: Several “smoking guns” and a graveyard of failed dark matter predictions.

Why “Conspiracy”?


The “conspiracy” isn’t about secret meetings—it’s about how groupthink and inertia have let a speculative idea become dogma, despite mounting contradictory evidence.



“All it takes is one result to prove a theory wrong.” – Einstein

Here are hundreds.


What’s Included


Replication kits for:
Pantheon+ (supernovae)
BAO (baryon acoustic oscillations)
Bullet Cluster
Einstein rings (lensing)
Real galaxies: NGC4395, NGC1003, NGC4013, NGC2915, IC2574, and more

Cold spot analyses
Code and data for every claim
Screenshots and visual proof
Ongoing updates as new anomalies are found
